title: Exercises for 'Meta-analysis in biological and environmental sciences'

---

The present site is the starting point for the exercises in R that we will be using  
to get our hands dirty and put into action topics that we have discussed in our lectures.  

[Day 1: Calculating effect sizes](pages/Day1.html)  
[Day 2: Hierarchical meta-analytical models](pages/Day2.html)  
[Day 3: Assumptions, biases and confounding effects](pages/Day3.html)  
[Day 4: Methodological issues, advances, and common mistakes](pages/Day4.html)  

We'll mostly use the 'metafor' package in R: [metafor](http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php)
