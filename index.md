The present site is the starting point for the exercises in R that we will be using  
to get our hands dirty and put into action topics that we have discussed in our lectures.  

### Before our course  

1. Install [R]() and [RStudio]().  
2. Install the following packages:

```
install.packages(c("metafor","compute.es","ggplot2","dplyr","reshape2","broom","tidyr"),quietly=TRUE)
```
3. If you already have R installed, please update it to the latest version 

```

install.packages('installr')
